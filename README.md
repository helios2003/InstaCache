# InstaCache

## Introduction
This project aims to implement a thread safe in memory cache with an option to choose the algorithm one wishes to implement for cache insertion and cache eviction policy.

The algorithms implmented are listed below:
- FIFO (First In First Out)
- LIFO (Last In First Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- LFU (Least Frequently Used)

## Getting started
- Create a fork or clone the repository directly using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/helios2003/InstaCache.git
```
- Change directory to `InstaCache`.
- Run the command ``python main.py <caching-strategy> <capacity>``.
- After that a menu driven program appears from which the necessary operation can be selected.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.xx
